## Usage

For outputting post publishing date or something else you can just pass the date to function `timeago.Take()`. It will count the interval between now and given date and returns converted format.

```go
timeago.Take("2019-10-23 10:46:00") // after 10 seconds outputs: 10 seconds ago
```

If you want to show last user login like if user is online or not, you can optionally add `|online` to the datetime string. All it does is just displaying **Online** if date interval withing 60 seconds.

```go
timeago.Take("2019-10-23 10:46:00|online")
```
